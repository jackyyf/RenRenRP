RenRenRP
========

RenRenRP is a small script, which simulates the "REFRESH" action to earn RenRen RP Point.    
Specially thanks [xiaohuangji](https://github.com/wong2/xiaohuangji-new) project, which provides the original RenRen class.  

Usage
-----
Just run `python renren.py` :)    
Or modify renren\_preconfig.py, and run `python renren_preconfig.py`.  

Requirements
------------
Scripts are tested on python 2.7.3.    
Requires requests (python-requests), you may use `pip install requests` to install.  
For windows users, after installing pip with get-pip.py, you may use `python -m pip install requests`.  

If you want to build windows binaries with PyInstallerBuild32.sh or PyInstallerBuild64.sh, you may need [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/), and dependencies required by pyinstaller.  
PyInstallerBuild32.sh is for x86/32bit, and PyInstallerBuild64.sh is for x64/64bit.  

Windows Binaries
----------------
From now on, for each release I will publish windows binaries for both x86 and x64.  
If you are not sure which architecture you are using, please download x86 one (compatible to x64).
