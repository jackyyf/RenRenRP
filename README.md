RenRenRP
========

RenRenRP is a small script, which simulates the "REFRESH" action to earn RenRen RP Point.    
Specially thanks [xiaohuangji](https://github.com/wong2/xiaohuangji-new) project, which provides the original RenRen class.  

Usage
-----
Just run `python renren.py` :)    
Or modify renren\_preconfig.py, and run `python renren_preconfig.py`.  

Branches
--------
Branch master is for daily develop, may be broken or not work at all.  
You may want to use stable branch, which contains source code of the latest stable release.  

Requirements
------------
Scripts are tested on python 2.7.3.    
Requires requests (python-requests), you may use `pip install requests` to install.  
For 0.1.x version, you may also need colorama for colorful console output, you may use `pip install colorama` to install.  
For windows users, after installing pip with get-pip.py, you may use `python -m pip` instead of `pip`.   

If you want to build windows binaries with PyInstallerBuild32.sh or PyInstallerBuild64.sh, you may need [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/), and dependencies required by pyinstaller.  
PyInstallerBuild32.sh is for x86/32bit, and PyInstallerBuild64.sh is for x64/64bit.  

Windows Binaries
----------------
From now on, for each release I will publish windows binaries for both x86 and x64.  
If you are not sure which architecture you are using, please download x86 one (compatible to x64).
